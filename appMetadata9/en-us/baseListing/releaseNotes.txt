9.6.0
* Upgraded to Rocky Linux 9.6
* Systemd by default: Now enabled and optimised for WSL, with conflicting services safely masked to ensure maximum compatibility.
* Desktop installer: Updated for newer desktop environments with clearer guidance, improved validation, and automatic hostname detection for greater discoverability.
* Graphics: Introduces a vGEM loader as a workaround for GPU video acceleration issues in WSL 2.5.x, alongside Mesa 24.2.8. Full codec support is now included, with VP9 and AV1 hardware acceleration enabled. This Mesa release also incorporates Microsoft OpenCLOn12, providing an OpenCL 1.2 implementation atop D3D12 for the first time.
* Windows Terminal: Profiles refreshed with portable launchers (no hard-coded paths), stable settings, and updated icons and backgrounds for a more polished experience.
* Quality-of-life (non-systemd users): Enhanced support for dbus and graphical applications when systemd is not in use. A new create_userpath.sh utility ensures /run/user/<uid> and /etc/xdg are present, while shell prompt scripts have been refined.
