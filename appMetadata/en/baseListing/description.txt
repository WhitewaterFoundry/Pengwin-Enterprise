Pengwin Enterprise is designed for custom deployments in consultation with Whitewater Foundry's international team of WSL experts.

Pengwin Enterprise is a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) solution compatible with Oracle Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

This build provided on the Microsoft Store is built from Scientific Linux, derived from the source code of CentOS, for demonstration purposes and personal use only.

Businesses and institutions who wish to license Pengwin Enterprise, use Pengwin Enterprise with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription required), and obtain a support contract for Pengwin Enterprise should e-mail enterprise@whitewaterfoundry.com or visit https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com for details.

Individual end-users are very strongly encouraged to obtain Pengwin or Fedora Remix for WSL instead. Pengwin includes end-user support and several usability modifications and tools, such as pengwin-setup, to improve the overall WSL experience for end-users.

The Pengwin Enterprise build provided on the Microsoft Store does NOT include Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages, end-user support, pengwin-setup, or the WSL usability features that accompany Pengwin or built into Pengwin Enterprise in a custom deployment.

Whitewater Foundry is a Microsoft Partner, Red Hat Business Partner, and licensee in the Open Innovation Network.

Pengwin Enterprise is not endorsed by or affiliated with the CentOS Project, Scientific Linux, or Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
